The 28th Rat is a small [QRF registered rattery](http://qrf.org.au) based in Brisbane, QLD. The rattery was established in 2008, consists of about 10-20 rats in one ferret kingdom cage, and is run by Keish (myself). I have one breeding project up to the 6th generation (as of writing in 2016) with the focus being on excellent health, temperament and conformation.

Generally I only have about 1-2 litters per year so it is a rare occasion that there are bubs available, but check the litters page to see what might be upcoming. Enquiries can go to [my facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/28rats) however due to high demand I don't take reservations. I keep my bubs until 12 weeks old & sell them for $25 each. If your rat/s don't go to plan I can offer a refund, however due to limited availability I can't offer replacements. When you purchase one of my rats you're also purchasing a lifetime supply of rat advice & help from myself, and if for some reason you need to rehome them, I do urge owners to return them to me and no questions will be asked.

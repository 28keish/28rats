The 28th Rat is a small [QRF registered rattery](http://qrf.org.au) based in Brisbane, QLD. The rattery was established in 2008, consists of about 10-20 rats in one ferret kingdom, and is run by Keish (myself). I have one breeding project up to the 6th generation (as of writing in 2016) with the focus being on excellent health, temperament and conformation -- in that order.

I'm a member of & volunteer for [Queensland Rodent Fanciers (QRF)](http://qrf.org.au/) -- a club where you can enter rats & mice in shows consisting of both varieties and "pet" classes. They advocate responsible pet ownership & breeding and generally are a really great way to meet other rodent owners and breeders. If anyone is curious about showing & has questions please feel free to [send me a facebook message](http://www.facebook.com/28rats) and I'll answer when I can.

##Interested in buying a rat?

I generally only have about 1-2 litters per year so it is a rare occasion that there are babies available, but check the litters page to see what might be upcoming. If there are bubs available I'll generally post to advertise on the [QRF facebook page](http://qrf.org.au) first, followed by the 28rats page. Due to high demand I don't take reservations.

Rats are $25 each and if things don't go to plan I'm happy to offer a refund, however due to limited availability I can't offer replacements. I keep all my rats until 12 weeks of age as I believe that's a more adequate amount of time to assess health and temperament to see if they are suitable for rehoming. If you purchase one of my rats you are also purchasing a lifetime supply of help & advice from myself, and if for some reason you need to rehome them, I do urge owners to return them to me and no questions will be asked.

I don't focus on colour/marking per-se so it's mostly "whatever goes" but at the moment (as of writing in 2016) I happen to have agouti, black, fawn, buff, silverfawn & champagne colours mostly in berkshires, irish and self markings. All are standard coats, perhaps some with unknown modifiers to affect the coat and make it a bit fluffier.
